"""
M.O.L.O.C.H. 3.0 Context Module
===============================

Neutral context registry for origin fragments and historical data.

This module is DECLARATIVE, not NARRATIVE:
- It lists what exists
- It does not interpret or judge
- It provides structure for future use

Origin fragments represent conversation histories from different AI systems
(ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) that may inform M.O.L.O.C.H.'s future development.
